# bumServerRemote - derivative 1
## Description:
Remote for the bums to start up the bum server when they're away.

## Important note:
This is only the receiving/incoming side of the remote, not the transmitting/outgoing side; in other words, this is for the server, not for the client(s). For the client/transmitting end, see https://github.com/Dave-New-Dev/bumServerRemote
